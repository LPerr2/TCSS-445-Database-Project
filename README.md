# TCSS-445-Database-Project
This project designs a relational database that models a real-world system with multiple entities and constraints. It reinforces core database skills such as ER modeling, normalization, primary and foreign keys, SQL queries, enforcing business rules, and writing analytical queries.

Inspired by my work at UPS, I modeled this project around my knowledge of their operations.
